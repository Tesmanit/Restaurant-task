Hi. This is my coursera project.
In this work i didn't use pipenv, instead i used venv.
If you open this project on windows, you're alright just use venv/Scripts/activate, but if you have another OS: 
1) create your venv for your OS (python3 -m venv '<Name you want to use for this folder>')
2) use (source '<Name you want to use for this folder>'/Scripts/activate)
3) use pip install -r requirements.txt(the file is provided in the same folder)

also, i exported my Insomnia collection for testing, so just import and use it


FOR ADMIN ACCESS:
login: admin

My code might not be very clean and well-structured, but it still works(i hope so)
